Development Plan
Step 1: Set Up Basic Chat Functionality
This initial step establishes the foundational elements of the chat platform, enabling basic messaging between customers and agents.
Customer Interface:
Design a simple, responsive chat window featuring an input field and a "Send" button.

Ensure the interface is accessible across devices, including desktops and mobile phones, for seamless customer access.
Backend:
Configure a server to receive messages sent by customers through POST requests.

Store messages in a database, linking each to a unique conversation identifier to track individual chats.
Agent Interface:
Create a basic interface displaying a list of incoming customer messages.

Enable agents to select a message from the list and send a reply to the corresponding customer.
Step 2: Enable Real-Time Communication
This step upgrades the platform to support live interactions, a key feature for effective customer support.
Websockets Integration:
Implement a websocket server to handle real-time messaging.

Modify the customer and agent interfaces to establish websocket connections for instant updates.
Real-Time Updates:
Ensure that when a customer sends a message, it appears immediately in the agent interface.

Guarantee that agent responses are instantly visible in the customer’s chat window.
Step 3: Manage Multiple Conversations
To handle multiple customers efficiently, this step introduces conversation tracking and assignment mechanisms.
Conversation Management:
Track active conversations using unique session identifiers.

Display a list of active chats in the agent interface, including statuses such as "waiting," "in progress," or "resolved."
Assignment System:
Develop a queue system to manage new conversations as they arrive.

Allow agents to manually select conversations from the queue or implement automatic assignment to available agents.

Ensure that once an agent begins responding, the conversation is assigned exclusively to them to prevent overlapping responses.
Step 4: Enhance the Agent Interface
This step improves the agent experience by adding features to streamline their workflow.
Conversation History:
Store and display the complete message history for each conversation, accessible when an agent selects a chat.
Resolution and Transfer:
Add a feature for agents to mark conversations as resolved once the customer’s issue is addressed.

Implement functionality to transfer a conversation to another agent if escalation or reassignment is needed.
Canned Responses:
Provide agents with the ability to save and use pre-written responses for frequently asked questions or common scenarios.
Step 5: Improve Customer Experience
Enhancing the customer side ensures a smooth and informative interaction with the platform.
Typing Indicators:
Display a "typing" indicator in the customer interface when an agent is composing a response.
Message Status:
Show message statuses such as "sent," "delivered," or "read" to keep customers informed about their message’s progress.
End Chat and Feedback:
Include a button allowing customers to end the chat session at their discretion.

Optionally, prompt customers for feedback or a satisfaction rating after the chat concludes to gauge service quality.
Step 6: Implement Security and Anonymity Measures
This step ensures the platform protects customer anonymity and maintains a secure environment.
Data Privacy:
Avoid storing personally identifiable information for anonymous customers.

Assign temporary, anonymous identifiers to customer sessions to link messages without compromising privacy.
Spam Prevention:
Implement rate limiting to restrict the frequency of messages from a single session, reducing spam risk.

Consider adding a CAPTCHA mechanism if spam or abuse becomes a significant issue.
Encryption:
Use HTTPS to secure all communications between customers, agents, and the backend.

Optionally, encrypt message content for an additional layer of security during transmission.
Step 7: Testing and Optimization
The final step validates the platform’s functionality and performance, preparing it for real-world use.
Functional Testing:
Test all features—such as message sending, real-time updates, and conversation management—to ensure they work as intended.

Simulate multiple simultaneous conversations to verify the system’s stability under load.
Performance Testing:
Conduct load testing to assess the platform’s capacity for handling concurrent chats.

Optimize the backend and database to improve performance, especially for real-time messaging.
User Feedback:
Gather feedback from a group of testers or potential users (both customers and agents).

Refine the platform based on this feedback to enhance usability and address any identified issues.
