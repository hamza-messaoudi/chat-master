1. Overall Layout & Navigation

    Unified Conversation Panel:
    Integrate the new features directly within the existing conversation window. Keep the chat view uncluttered while using slide-out or pop-up panels for advanced settings.

    Action Bar:
    Place a dedicated action bar above or alongside the input field where agents can quickly access LLM tools, select prompts, or toggle automation features.

2. LLM-Assisted Manual Response

    LLM Response Button:

        Placement: Next to the message input field.

        Function: When an agent clicks this button, it calls the connected LLM to generate a response suggestion.

        Feedback: The suggested text appears directly in the input field, allowing the agent to review, edit, or send it immediately.

        Indicator: Use a subtle loader animation on the button to indicate processing.

    Editable Input Field:
    Ensure the auto-generated text is fully editable so that the agent can modify it to personalize the message before sending.

3. Defining and Selecting LLM Prompts

    Prompt Management Panel:

        Access: Include an icon (e.g., a gear or lightbulb) near the LLM response button.

        Display: When clicked, a modal or side panel appears, listing available LLM prompts.

        Features:

            Search/Filter Options: Let agents quickly search through their saved prompts.

            Prompt Categories: Group prompts by use-case (e.g., greetings, troubleshooting, escalation).

            Create/Edit/Delete: Provide options to define new prompts, modify existing ones, or remove unused ones.

            Preview: Allow a preview of the prompt output (sample response) when hovered over or selected.

    Prompt Selection:
    Agents can select a prompt, and its template is automatically applied to the LLM call when generating a response. Visual confirmation (like highlighting) shows which prompt is currently active.

4. Automating Responses with Timers

    Automation Toggle:

        Design: Incorporate a clear on/off switch for automated responses on the action bar.

        State Indicators: Use color changes (e.g., green for active, gray for inactive) to indicate the automation status.

    Timer Setup & Configuration:

        Modal or Inline Widget: When automation is activated, display options for setting timers.

        Timer Controls:

            Countdown Timer: Visual representation (e.g., a countdown bar or numeric timer) indicating time left before the automated response is sent.

            Custom Intervals: Allow agents to specify default delays for when no agent is available or when traffic is high.

    Automation Rules:

        Contextual Conditions: Let agents define conditions (e.g., "if no response within 2 minutes" or "if agent is offline") that trigger automated messages.

        Review Automation: Provide a summary section that lists active automated tasks and their settings.

5. Intervention: Stopping Automation and Manual Takeover

    Immediate Override Button:

        Placement: Display an easily accessible “Stop Automation” button or icon (like a pause symbol) directly on the conversation panel.

        Visibility: The button should be prominent during an ongoing automated sequence.

        Functionality: Clicking it cancels the automated response immediately, and the conversation shifts to manual mode.

    Agent Takeover Notification:

        Alert Mechanism: When an agent intervenes, show a small confirmation notification (e.g., "You have taken over the conversation").

        Seamless Transition: Ensure that any auto-generated text that might be pending is cleared, allowing for a smooth handover.

6. Additional Considerations

    Accessibility:

        Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-navigable.

        Provide tooltips and accessible labels for each icon/button for clarity.

    Feedback & Error Handling:

        Include confirmation messages and error alerts (e.g., “Failed to generate response, please try again”) for smooth interaction.

        Use animations or progress indicators to show processing states.

    Customization & Settings:

        Allow agents to customize default LLM prompts and automation timers via a settings menu.

        Save preferences so that frequent users have a personalized experience across sessions.
